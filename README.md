# Project Charter 

## Objectives 

The main objective of the project is to design, build and operate a cubesat, in an open source, open development project gathering young motivated people, and mentors of the aerospace or engineering industry. 

The project is non profit and mostly for educational purposes. 

## Project Organisation 

Four roles are defined 

CORE TEAM - Trusted project administrators 

Project Manager - Ensure organisation and communication is healthy 

Contributor - Trusted participant with github organisation access

Participant - Contributors to the project without trusted repo access 


A particular attention is put on the will to keep the hierarchy as flat as possible. 

## Project Mission 
	
Project Mission is defined as the WP aggregation. 
The mission consists of the operation of two 0.5U cubesats to measure the effectiveness of a deorbiting system and take measurements of the LEO environment. 

## Decisions 

All decisions relating to the project must be taken as transparently and democratically as possible. 

Everyone is free to make proposals but cannot demand their application without the agreement of the whole CORE TEAM. 

## Communication / Open Source 

All participants in the project are required to document their work in order to achieve our open source, open development goal. The CORE TEAM's mission is then to publish what needs to be published.





## Money 

No one should be able to take advantage of any of the money that would be provided for the project. People can invest their own money in the project, but expenses will only be reimbursed if they were discussed with and accepted by at least two core team members prior to expenditure.

## Transition from the old project to the new 

The name of the project and its logo may be changed, towards a name more evocative of the open source. 

Who is allowed to work on the project ? 

People from the old server can join as long as the invite link is active. After that they will be regarded as new people. New people can join the new discord server and read all channels. They can only write in channel #introduce-yourself, #main-chat and #casual-conversation. From there on we can talk to them and figure out if they want to help and what they can do. Anyone is encouraged to fork project repos, build changes, and submit them as pull requests - ideally with discussion with the team in the server.

What do we use from the old project ? 

Everything except organisation structure will be used from the old project.

How long do we leave the link on the old server ?

We will leave the link to the new discord server on the old server for 4 weeks.
